title: Quick view to JxCore Thali plugin architecture (android part)
---

I'm heading for vacation and wanted to give better view on how the android parts for the jxcore plugin are constructed, thus decide to explain the arhitecture of the plugin in a blog post.

If you are interested to see how it internally works, then check the details see my [blog article](http://www.drjukka.com/blog/wordpress/?p=140)
