title: Bluetooth P2P sync for Android using insecure sockets
---
Don't know where the idea for this artile came from, but I heard it from Yaron. Basically we wanted to see whether we could simply poll known bluetooth addresses to discover peers.

We had no idea how well that would work, or what it would do for the batterylife, so I made some tests with the technlogy and got results.

So check out the findings from  my [blog article](http://www.drjukka.com/blog/wordpress/?p=121)
