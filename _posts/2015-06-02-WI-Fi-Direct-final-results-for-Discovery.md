title: WI-Fi Direct final results for Discovery
---
Did finally notice that there was one bad assumption in my thoughts about the power consumption of the WiFi direct discovery. Basically I though that it does not matter whether I have peers around or not.

Anyway, happy to be set strait on the issue, and the results are now in, for more see my [blog article](http://www.drjukka.com/blog/wordpress/?p=124)
